## Shazam for art

### Machine-Learning-Practice

[Based on this tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/)

##This Practice looks at:

1. Installing the Python and SciPy platform.
2. Loading the dataset.
3. Summarizing the dataset.
4. Visualizing the dataset.
5. Evaluating some algorithms.
6. Making some predictions.

##I installed the following:

* scipy
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* sklearn


1. Import Libraries
2. Load Dataset
3. Get visualisation on the data

Tuesday:
We set out to answer these three key questions:
  1. Which feature extraction to do first? HOG, Pixel, Colour Histogram etc
  2. What is the order of the scikit pipeline?
  3. How does classification work?
      - Do we implement 'supervised'
      - Do we implement 'unsupervised'
  4. Imported algorithm from scikit-learn to process an 'unseen' image vs our image bank and return a value. 0 => Lowry, 1 => Turner. Our program successfully assigned the correct value to the unseen image.
  5. MVP reached

 ##User Stories:
 
 ```
 As a User 
 So that I can identify a picture/ artwork piece
 I want to be able to upload an image of this picture/artwork piece
 
 As a User 
 So that I can learn who the artist is
 I want receive the name of the artist on screen
  
 As a User
 So that I can save search logs
 I want to be able to sign in/sign out
 
 As a User 
 So that I can learn more about art/artists
 I want to be reccomended more information by the app
